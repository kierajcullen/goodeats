# Good Eats
Our project incorporates two APIs and allows users to optimize their recipe search by ingredient or title. Our team worked together to create a responsive website that is incredibly user friendly. Our sleek and stylish UI will appeal to mothers, fathers, grandmothers, grandfathers and everyone in between. This will help clients of all ages eliminate waste from their fridge or pantry. Eventually, we would like to add a feature for nutrition that will allow users to track their macros.
